            About Me
          </h2>
          <p>
            After graduating highschool I went to Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo in order to study economics. The scenery and isolation of the town made me introspective and got me focused on what 
            I wanted to do with my life. 
            Eventually, after countless fishing trips and several soccer matches I came accross computer engineering. Despite being an economics major I took several computer science courses
            during my time at Cal Poly that helped me extend my appreciation for software development, specifically how I was able to work with peers and solve problems with our 
            code by taking multiple approaches. 
            The fact that most items in modern technology function through the use of code fascinates me and helped me gain a new level of appreciation for this career pathway. 
            I began to analyze what type of programs that make planes, cash registers, or websites run and what functions they utilize. As an avid chess player I enjoy coding, 
            almost like finding your best path to a checkmate, and I view debugging as mending your position after a blunder.
            However, continuing my career in software 
            engineering at Thinkful seemed to be a more fitting option for me due to circumstances going on in my life at that point. After joining the software engineer 
            program at Thinkful, I was able to really focus on computer engineering. I have had the opportunity to be mentored by like minded people who made my current dream come true 
            in their own careers. This whole community that I just discovered has been so welcoming and its truly exciting to see how people work together to achieve a common 
            goal. I can't wait to be an official member of the community and aid the community through my code as well as learn from my peers. Throughout the process of taking this course 
            I have further confirmed my interest in this field of study, and await the journey that my career will take me through.
