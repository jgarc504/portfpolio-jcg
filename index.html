            About Me
          </h2>
          <p>
            After gradtuating highschool I went to Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo in order to study economics. During my time at Cal Poly I took several computer science courses
            that helped me extend my appreciation for software development. Consequently, I attempted a major change into Computer Engineering. However, since the major was 
            so impacted, the transfer of majors was an almost impossible task. After joining the software engineer program at Thinkful, I was able to really focus on computer 
            engineering. Throughout the process of taking this course I have further confirmed my interest in this field of study, and await the journey that my career will take 
            me through.
