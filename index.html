            About Me
          </h2>
          <p>
            After gradtuating highschool I went to Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo in order to study economics. During my time at Cal Poly I took several computer science courses
            that helped me extend my appreciation for software development, specifically how I was able to work with peers and solve problems with our code by taking multiple apporoaches. 
            The fact that we could accomplish a project together despite working during different times and without communicating extensively amazed me, after discovering
            that this is how a majority of interactions go down in this field, I gained a new level of appreciation for this career pathway. However, continuing my career in software 
            engineering at Thinkful seemed to be a more fitting option for me due to circumstances going on in my life at that point. After joining the software engineer 
            program at Thinkful, I was able to really focus on computer engineering. I have had the opportunity to be mentored by like minded people who made my current dream come true 
            in their own careers. This whole community that I just discovered has been so welcoming and its truly exciting to see how people work together to achieve a common 
            goal. I can't wait to be an official member of the community and aid the community through my code as well as learn from my peers. Throughout the process of taking this course 
            I have further confirmed my interest in this field of study, and await the journey that my career will take me through.
